            <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a child, I have been captivated by the magic of technology. As soon as I could, I joined the robotics
            club in middle school, where I got my first taste of programming. I loved the challenge of making robots move and solve
            problems, but as I got older, my interests shifted toward economics and mathematics. I pursued those subjects
            academically, drawn to their logic and real-world applications, and for a while, I left programming behind. However, my
            curiosity never faded, and I eventually found myself tinkering with code again, building small side projects just for
            fun. The more I learned, the more I realized how much I enjoyed creating software and solving problems through code.
            What started as a hobby quickly grew into a passion, and I decided to transition into programming full-time. Now, I’m
            fully immersed in software development, combining my analytical background with my love for technology to build
            meaningful and innovative projects. </p>

            <h2>Why I Love Computer Science</h2>
            <p>What I love most about computer science is its ability to turn imagination into reality. With just a few lines of code,
            an idea can transform into something transformative. There are no limits, whether it’s
            building massive applications, or creating entire virtual worlds, everything is possible with the right skills and
            creativity. The most fulfilling part is knowing that something you build can be used by millions, impacting lives in
            ways you never expected. It’s an incredible feeling to have that kind of power at your fingertips, where one person can make a massive impact. The constant evolution of technology ensures that there’s always something new to learn, another boundary to
            push. That’s what makes computer science so exciting—it’s a field where imagination is your only limit.</p>
